# Quota-based Knative Hybrid Autoscaling Operator
as in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2024.06.019

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.20.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Knative cluster to run against.
**Note:** This operator was built and tested on: (Recommended for testing)
- Ubuntu version 18.04.5/6
- Kubernetes v1.23.5
- Istio
- Knative v1.8 (Serving and Eventing v1.8.5, Knative Istio Controller v1.8.0)
For installing the above environment, please refer to knative_install.md file.


### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### For Testing
0. Kubectl apply the 3 target services as given in prequisites_service_deployment
1. Delete any DRLScalingAction CR in cluster if running the test again from the beginning
3. Run Locust Traffic Profile as given in prequisites_traffic_generator_files (Not generate traffic yet)
4. Build and Install the CRDs into the cluster (Only first time)

```sh
make                              #make all
make manifests                    #Generate CRD
kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases #Apply CRD
```

5. Run Quota-Based Knative HybridScaling controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

6. Start Generating Traffic to Service URL using Locust UI (HostURL:8089)
**Note:** Traffic need to be predicted before the actual new traffic change happening
- For example: Predict Traffic at every second 55 in a minute ("schedule.every().minute.at(":55").do(lambda: predict(api)")
- Then Start Generating Traffic at second >= 00 (example predicting at 0:55, new traffic change at 1:00)

7. Start DRL Agent Service (refer to https://github.com/mipearlska/DRL_knative_scale_limit_resources for installation and running guide)
- This service might take up until 1 minute to start up (loading libraries, etc.)
- Recommended Running flow: Start Prediction service (running python3 main.py) at 0:40, Start Traffic Generation at 1:00
- First Prediction will happen at 1:55, at 0:55 the Prediction service is still starting up
- If your system startup the Prediction service fast, delay the Start Prediction service time to a later second (<55)
- Reason: Prediction Service up before 0:55, first prediction happen at 0:55 while the traffic has not been generated yet (scheduled to start at 1:00)
